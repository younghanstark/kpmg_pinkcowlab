<p class="lead">
    <strong>Magam</strong> is a service that determines whether people who pass through the subway gate wear masks. You
    can quickly and
    accurately determine whether a large number of people are wearing masks with a single camera, such as a
    smartphone and a webcam. With our software, people can follow the quarantine rules and reduce the risk of COVID-19
    infection.
